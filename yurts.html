    <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>
    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
    <p>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.</p>
